### Starting Pepper Seeds Indoors.

#### When to Start?

Most people say to start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. For beginner gardeners this can be a hard date to figure out, so check out [almanac.com](https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates) for you local average last frost date. When it comes to Hot Peppers this can be troublesome though. Some hot pepper seeds have been known to take up to six weeks to germinate. That is insane! For hotter varieties, I plan to start seeds at least 12 weeks before the last frost date. This puts my starting date around New Years in zone 7b. If you want to start seeds earlier indoors you must checkout [Light Requirements](#light-requirements) to make sure you are giving your plants the best shot of getting ahead.

#### Temperature and Humidity

###### Temperature

Temperature plays a large role in the germination process of all types of seeds, especially pepper seeds.
> ###### Ambient Air Temps:
> Ambient air temperature should be in the range of 70°F (21.1°C) and 95°F (35°C)
> ###### Soil Temps:
>Soil Temperature range between 80°F (27°C) to 90°F (32°C) is essential for pepper germination.

###### Humidity
Humidity also plays a factor in germinating pepper seeds. If you have too much humidity your seeds may be subject to disease and mold. On the other side, having too little humidty will cause soil to dry out and seeds will not germinate proplery. There is a sweet spot when it comes to relative humidity which is between 50% and 70%. There are plenty of options on the market that check for humidity in the air such as [Govee Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Temperature-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Greenhouse/dp/B08CGM8DC7/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=humidity+sensor&qid=1631137945&sr=8-9). This monitor has excellent reviews, and offers bluetooth connection with almost any smartphone.

TIPS: I like to use old aquariums as my humidity domes when working with large amounts of seedlings or propagating cuttings. Place on of the vivosun heating mats inside the aquarium with plant trays on top. Then completely cover aquarium with lid to conserve humidity. With this option, you will need to exchange the air in the aquarium at least once or twice a day.

#### Growing Medium

Many options are flooding the market when it comes to growing medium. I hear that people use peat moss, coco coir, perlite, sand, mulch, potting soil, and many more varieties and mixtures.

I don't believe in adding all these extra steps into the process of germinating seeds when it comes to the ground I put them in. However, I do believe in finding a good quality potting mix to start seeds in. You have the choice between potting mixes with or without fertilizers, I have not found there is much of a differece in germination rates.

#### When to fertilize

If you use one of the above options, fertilize is not needed for the first few months. Check if your growing medium contains fertilizer and if it does not you should choose to start liquid fertilizer or slow release pellets. A general rule of thumb is to fertilize seedlings about two weeks after germination. one third to one half strength of the normal applied fertilizer should do at this point, as there are not many roots to uptake nutrients. Depending on the type of fertilizer and the strength applied reapplication will be needed every 1-2 weeks.

Many fertilizers that are targeted towards tomatos, also work great on peppers.
