### Where to buy Pepper seeds?

Have you ever wondered where you can buy pepper seeds from? Most local home improvement and garden supply stores carry some of the most common varieties such as JalapeÃ±o, Bell Peppers, Cayenne, or Banana Peppers. You may run across a few Habanero plants early in the season, but those tend to be grabbed quickly. There are other options for those that are looking for rare or super hot varieties of Peppers. I have compiled a list of my Top 4 favorite places to purchase peppers seeds.

## 1. Pepper Joe's
